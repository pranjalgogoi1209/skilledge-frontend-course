# Pseudo-classes : 

A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example, :hover can be used to change a button's color when the user's pointer hovers over it.

/* Any button over which the user's pointer is hovering */
button:hover {
  color: blue;
}

# We have two types of pseudo class:----
1.Dynamic . eg: hover
2.Advanced structural . eg: parent child relationship


# User action pseudo-classes/DYNAMIC PSEUDO CLASS
=These pseudo-classes require some interaction by the user in order for them to apply, such as holding a mouse pointer over an element.
eg: 
:hover
Matches when a user designates an item with a pointing device, for example holding the mouse pointer over it.

:active
Matches when an item is being activated by the user, for example clicked on or hold the click button .

:focus
Matches when an element has focus.

:focus-visible
Matches when an element has focus and the user agent identifies that the element should be visibly focused.

:focus-within
Matches an element to which :focus applies, plus any element that has a descendant to which :focus applies.
