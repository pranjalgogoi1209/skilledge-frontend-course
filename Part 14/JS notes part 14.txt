# WHY FUNCTIONS ARE CALLED FIRST CLASS CITIZEN ?
    1. functions as values
    2. functions as arguments
    3. return as value within a function

# CALLBACK FUNCTION : A JavaScript callback is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished execution. A more formal definition would be - Any function that is passed as an argument to another function so that it can be executed in that other function is called as a callback function

# SETTIMEOUT METHOD : The setTimeout() method schedules a one-time callback after the specified time in milliseconds

# FOR EACH METHOD : The forEach() method calls a function for each element in an array.
                    array.forEach(function(item, index){});

# MAP METHOD : map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element.
                newArray=array.map(function(item){return });

# FIND METHOD : The find() method returns the value of the first element that passes a test. The find() method executes a function for each array element

# FILTER METHOD : The JavaScript filter array function is used to filter an array based on specified criteria

# SOME METHOD : The some() method of Array instances tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function

# EVERY METHOD : The every() method executes a function for each array element. The every() method returns true if the function returns true for all elements
