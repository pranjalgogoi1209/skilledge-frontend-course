 #VARIABLE:

*Variables are like  "labeled jars" for a value in Javascript. 
*We can store a value and give it a name, so that we can -
    -recall it
    -use it 
    -or change it later on.
*How to create a variable:
    =We have 3 keywords to create variable:
        1.let
        2.const
        3.var
            eg:
                let age=72;
            eg2:
                let parentsAge=50;
                let childAge=parentsAge-30;
*A variable name cann't be a keyword/object like let, const, var, document.


#KEYWORDS:

Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in programming that have special meanings to the compiler.
    eg:
        let is a keyword, which is use to create a variable. We cann't give variable name as any keyword.


#TYPES OF CASES:

*snake_case : Use in Django to create apps.
*PascalCase : Use in Python, Django to create classes.
*camelCase : Use in Javascript to create variable.
*This is not a rule from these programming languages that we need to use these cases, But It is a convension made by these programming language community.


#RULES TO DECLARING A VARIABLE:

*We have to use let/const/var keyword before the variable name.
*Variable name can't be a keyword or object, like let , document.
*We should use cases like, snake case or camel case: camel case is preferable for JavaScript.
    snake case=number_of_children
    camel case=numberOfChildren
*We don't need to define the type of variable whether it is int or float , like C,C++,Java.
*We cannot redecalare same name variable twice in a file with let keyword. But we can update the same variable.
*We can redecalare same name variable twice in a file with var keyword and we can update the same variable as well.
*var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope.
*let variables can be updated but no re-declared. 
*const variables can neither be updated nor re-delared.


#SYNTAX OF VARIABLE:

    let someName=value;


#iMPORTANT:

*We can recall the variable.
    let myAge=23;
    let myFatherAge=46;
    let ourAgeGape=myFatherAge-myAge; //23
*We can update the variable.
    let age=22;
    age=age-2;
    //Now the value of age is 20
    age=45;
    //Now the value of age is 45
*If we want a constant variable then we should use const keyword while declaring the variable.
    const pi=3.14;
    //Now no one can change or update this pi variable.
*We have 3 ways to declare a variable
    i. let = It has been using since ES6 (means from 2015).
    ii. const = It uses to make a variable constant, so that no one can change or update the variable.
    iii. var = It has been using since Javascript created.
*Before let & const, var was the only way of declaring variables. But These days, there isn't really a reason to use it.
*The Difference between let and var are-----
    i. We can't redeclare the variable with let keyword , On the other hand We can redeclare the variable with var keyword.
*Always write the name of a boolean value starting with is.... 
    eg:
        let isIndia=true;


#OPERATORS:

1.UNARY OPERATOR:
    eg1: 
        let age=22;
        age=age+1;
            //or
        age+=1
        //Both answer will be same , which is 23
    eg2:
        let apple=2;
        let banana=5;
        banana=banana+apple;
            //or
        banana+=apple;
        //Both answer will be same, which is 7
2.INCREAMENT & DECREAMENT:
    *Preincreament & Predecreament:
        let age=22;
        ++age;  //It means age+1(Preincreament)
        --age;  //It means age-1(Predecreament)
            eg:
                let windSpeed=75;
                windSpeed+=6;   //Now WindSpeed is 81
                windSpeed++;    //Now WindSpeed is 81
                //(We don't neet to store value of INCREAMENT or DECREAMENT variables, It stores automatically)
    *Postincreament & Postdecreament:
        let age=22;
        age++;  //It means age+1(Postincreament)
        age--;  //It means age-1(Postdecreament)
