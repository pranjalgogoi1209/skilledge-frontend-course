# FUNCTION : A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

# ARGUMENT : The parameters, in a function call, are the function's arguments. JavaScript arguments are passed by value: The function only gets to know the values, not the argument's locations. If a function changes an argument's value, it does not change the parameter's original value.

# PARAMETER : unction parameters are the names listed in the function definition. Function arguments are the real values passed to (and received by) the function.
