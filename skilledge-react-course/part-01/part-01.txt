# NODE JS : 
    i. It's use for backend
    ii. But It has Node Package Manager (NPM)
    iii. We will use NPM in react js, So we have to install it

# check version of nodejs : 
    node -v

# CREATE APP
    npx create-next-app myapp

# create vite app
    npm create vite@latest
    npm install  : for node modules

# RUN DEV LOCAL HOST
    npm run dev

# In future we have to learn type script, it's superset of javascript , but we have to transpile(convert) typescript file to javascript file, bcz browser only understand javascript
